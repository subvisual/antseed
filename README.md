# AntSeed

A peer-to-peer AI services network. Providers offer AI services, buyers discover providers via DHT and route requests through encrypted P2P connections.

**Live pricing:** see [PRICING.md](PRICING.md) or `https://network.antseed.com/stats` (public JSON, no auth).

## How It Works

**Providers** run a provider plugin that connects to an upstream LLM API (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible APIs, local Ollama, etc.) and announce capacity on the DHT network.

**Buyers** run a router plugin that discovers providers, scores them on price/latency/reputation, and proxies requests through a local HTTP endpoint that drop-in replaces `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` or `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

## Terms of Use

AntSeed is infrastructure for building differentiated AI services — not for raw resale of API keys or subscription access. Providers are expected to add value through domain-specific skills, agent workflows, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), fine-tuned models, or other product differentiation. Reselling personal subscription credentials (e.g., Claude Pro/Team plans) violates the upstream provider's terms of service and is not permitted. Always review your API provider's usage policies before offering capacity on the network. Subscription-based provider plugins (e.g., `provider-claude-code`, `provider-claude-oauth`) are provided for local testing and development only.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build everything
pnpm run build

# Create config once
node apps/cli/dist/cli/index.js seller setup

# Start providing
node apps/cli/dist/cli/index.js seller start

# Start buying
node apps/cli/dist/cli/index.js buyer start
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @antseed/cli
antseed seller setup  # Create ~/.antseed/config.json
antseed seller start  # Start providing
antseed buyer start   # Start buying
```

`~/.antseed/config.json` is the main source of truth for providers, services, pricing, categories, ports, and `baseUrl`. Environment variables are primarily for secrets such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `ANTSEED_IDENTITY_HEX`.

### Coinbase onramp (sandbox)

The buyer deposit view can offer a Coinbase card/bank onramp. The CDP **Secret**
API key is account-level, so it is read from the environment on the payments
server and never written to `config.json` or exposed to the browser:

```bash
export ANTSEED_COINBASE_API_KEY_ID="organizations/{org}/apiKeys/{key}"
export ANTSEED_COINBASE_API_KEY_SECRET="<base64 CDP secret>"
```

Their presence is the sole enable signal. `config.json` contributes only the
non-secret routing flag:

```json
{ "payments": { "onramp": { "coinbase": { "sandbox": true } } } }
```

With `sandbox: true` the widget opens against `pay-sandbox.coinbase.com`
(test funds). This local, per-desktop route is a **sandbox scaffold only** —
production requires an AntSeed-hosted mint endpoint so the secret key never
ships to user machines.

## Metrics and Monitoring

Antseed includes a native Prometheus-compatible exporter:

```bash
antseed metrics serve --role seller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9108
antseed metrics serve --role buyer --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9108
```

See [Metrics](apps/website/docs/guides/metrics.md) for endpoint details, metric names, labels, and operational notes.

## Development

### Optional Nix dev shell

This repository includes a Nix flake for contributors who want a pinned local
toolchain. The flake provides Node.js, pnpm, Python, native build tools, Git, and
Linux keychain dependencies used by the workspace. It does not replace the
normal pnpm workflow.

```bash
nix develop
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

If flakes are not enabled globally, run the shell with the required experimental
features for a single command:

```bash
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' develop
```

```bash
pnpm install            # Install all dependencies
pnpm run build          # Build in dependency order
pnpm run test           # Run all tests
pnpm run typecheck      # Type-check all packages
pnpm run clean          # Remove all dist/ directories
pnpm run dev:website    # Start website dev server
pnpm run dev:desktop    # Build deps + start desktop in dev mode
```

## Building a Plugin

Providers and routers are npm packages that export a plugin manifest:

```bash
antseed plugin create my-provider --type provider
```

See [packages/node/README.md](packages/node/README.md) for the `Provider` and `Router` interfaces, and [plugins/provider-claude-oauth/README.md](plugins/provider-claude-oauth/README.md) for a full plugin walkthrough.
